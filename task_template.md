# IT Warehouse Management System â€“ Task Template

## Overview
This template breaks down the requirements into actionable tasks for building a centralized IT materials management system. The project will use Clean Architecture principles, ASP.NET Core 9 for the API, Entity Framework Core for data access, SQL Server for storage, and a client application (web or desktop).

---

## 1. Project Setup

- [x] Initialize solution structure (API, Client, Core, Infrastructure, Shared)
- [x] Configure Clean Architecture folder structure
- [x] Set up ASP.NET Core 9 Web API project
- [x] Set up Entity Framework Core with SQL Server
- [x] Create initial database migration and apply to SQL Server
- [x] Set up client project (e.g., React, Blazor, or WPF)

---

## 2. Domain Modeling

- [x] Define entities:
    - User (with Role property: Manager, Employee, Gast)
    - Material
    - Order
    - MovementLog
    - Notification
- [x] Define enums:
    - MaterialStatus (New, Used, Damaged, Retired)
    - MovementType (Procurement, Issue, Return, Reissue, Damage)
    - Role (Manager, Employee, Gast)
- [x] Create value objects:
    - SerialNumber
    - MaterialType
    - Condition
- [x] Establish relationships:
    - User can have multiple Orders
    - Order can contain one or more Materials
    - Material is linked to MovementLog and Order
    - MovementLog tracks all movements for each Material

---

## 3. Data Access Layer (Infrastructure)

- [x] Implement DbContext and entity configurations
- [x] Set up repositories for each aggregate root
- [ ] Implement Unit of Work pattern (if needed)
- [x] Seed initial data for testing

---

## 4. Application Layer (Core)

- [x] Define use cases/services:
    - Material Lifecycle Management
    - Material Issue/Checkout
    - Material Return
    - Used Material Reissue
    - Damaged/Retired Material Handling
    - Inventory Tracking
    - Material Movement Logging
    - Orders & Approvals Workflow
    - Reporting & Audit
- [x] Implement business rules and validation logic
- [x] Create DTOs and mapping profiles

---

## 5. API Layer

- [x] Implement controllers/endpoints for:
    - Materials (CRUD, status updates)
    - Orders (request, approve, reject)
    - Employees (register, view, update)
    - Managers (approve/reject, reporting)
    - Warehouse Staff (stock management)
    - Movement Logs (history, audit)
    - Notifications (pending requests, approvals)
- [x] Secure endpoints with role-based authorization
- [x] Implement error handling and validation responses

---

## 6. Client Application

- [ ] Design UI for:
    - Material inventory (view, filter by status/type)
    - Request/order materials
    - Approve/reject requests (manager)
    - Return materials
    - View movement history
    - Reporting dashboard
    - Notifications
- [ ] Integrate with API endpoints
- [ ] Implement authentication and role-based access
- [ ] Add real-time updates/notifications (SignalR or polling)

---



## 7. User Permissions & Roles

- [x] Implement authentication (e.g., ASP.NET Identity, JWT)
- [x] Define roles: Employee, Manager, Warehouse Staff
- [ ] Enforce permissions in API and client


---

## 8. Material Movement Tracking

- [ ] Log every material movement (procurement, issue, return, reissue, damage)
- [ ] Provide complete history per material (API & UI)
- [ ] Ensure audit trail integrity

---

## 9. Orders & Approvals Workflow

- [ ] Implement order/request submission (employee)
- [ ] Manager approval/rejection workflow
- [ ] Notifications for pending requests/approvals
- [ ] Track order status and history

---

## 10. Reporting & Audit

- [ ] Implement reporting endpoints (stock levels, movements, issued/returned/damaged)
- [ ] Design reporting UI (manager dashboard)
- [ ] Ensure audit trail for all operations

---

## 11. Testing & Quality Assurance

- [ ] Write unit tests for core logic and services
- [ ] Write integration tests for API endpoints
- [ ] Test client workflows and UI
- [ ] Validate security and permissions
- [ ] Perform edge case and boundary testing

---

## 12. Documentation

- [ ] Document API endpoints (Swagger/OpenAPI)
- [ ] Write user guides for client application
- [ ] Document architecture and design decisions

---

## 13. Deployment

- [ ] Prepare deployment scripts (Docker, Azure, IIS, etc.)
- [ ] Set up CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Configure environment variables and secrets
- [ ] Finalize production database setup

---

## 14. Maintenance & Future Enhancements

- [ ] Plan for scalability (batch operations, archiving)
- [ ] Add advanced reporting (trends, forecasts)
- [ ] Integrate with external systems (procurement, HR)
- [ ] Implement mobile client (optional)
